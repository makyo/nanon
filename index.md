# Nanon

Nanon is an artificial language originally created in 2002 by Madison Scott-Clary as a way to alleviate the boredom of a Latin class. For a while, all digital copies were lost, with one [hard copy and notes](old/Nanon.pdf) remaining in a binder in Madison's bookshelf. Now, sixteen years later, the docs have been scanned and the language is being typed up again.
